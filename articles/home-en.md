Currently a developer at Dawex, I work primarily with Java Spring, Vue.js (version 3), Python, and Docker technologies.

Regarding operating systems, I have good knowledge of Windows, but my system of choice is Linux. I have fairly advanced knowledge of distributions derived from Debian, RedHat, Alpine, and Arch.

In terms of databases, I work primarily with relational models (PostgreSQL in particular), but I have also had the opportunity to work with NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, Neo4j, and Redis.

During my studies, my final year was specialized in everything related to data science, so I can use Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, SciPy, or Keras to perform data analysis or create basic machine learning models.

In recent years, I have been following the latest developments in AI by running numerous small-scale LLM models on an Ollama server hosted at my home. I believe these technologies can be a real added value if they are properly integrated into modern software solutions.
